What I have:

-PFF College Stats
-NFL First 3 years Stats
-Measurements
-SRS

What Else do I need?:

- seperate college stats by last 2 years (this means probably cutting out 2015 draft, as they would only have 1 yr of ncaa stats)
- join into 1 df
-detail and define plan for model. what am I predicting? whats the plan after the model? 
-run model




updated plan. due to GPT reccommendations (that I should know given I just took SAL313...) I will be doing a random forest instead
